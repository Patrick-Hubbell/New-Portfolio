### My New Portfolio ðŸ˜„
<hr>

At the time I am writing this my new portfolio is nearly complete. This of course brings me one step closer to world domination, my ultimate goal. 

## Tech Used
<hr>

I personally enjoy using ReactJs a lot so that was a simple choice and I feel it was an effectve one too. From there I found that it was a great opportunity to learn the still new CSS Grid, which works wonderfully and more importantly simply! 

Of course I feel some credit is due to Git/Github allowing me to develop on many different computers. This also gave me a chance to get expossure to different dev enviroments(Sublime, VScode, Sourcetree, Etc). 

## Where to now?

The finishing touches of development and deployment, using this portfolio to find a job and ultimately world domination!
