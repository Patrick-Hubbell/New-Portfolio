# My New Portfolio ðŸ˜„
At the time I am writing this my new portfolio is nearly complete. This of course brings me one step closer to world domination, my ultimate goal. 

# Tech Used

I personally enjoy using ReactJs a lot so that was a simple choice and I feel it was an effectve one too. From there I found that it was a great opportunity to learn the still new CSS Grid, which works wonderfully and more importantly simply! 

Of course I feel some credit is due to Git/Github allowing me to develop on many different computers. This also gave me a chance to get expossure to different dev enviroments(Sublime, VScode, Sourcetree, Etc). 

I've added some Flexbox to clean up how a couple things look. Fun fact; CSS Grid was actaully designed to work with Flexbox, and being that both of them are soooo user friendly, it's really a beuatyful thing.

# Where to now?

The finishing touches of development and deployment, using this portfolio to find a job and ultimately world domination!

# The Final Update

With the finishing touches put on there is only one thing left to do....
