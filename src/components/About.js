					<h1>Hello World, my name is Patrick Hubbell</h1>
					<h5>There are two types of Data Scientists.<br></br>1) Those who know how to extrapolate from missing data. </h5>
				</div>
				<p><i>I am</i> a Data Scientist based in the Greater Seattle Area. Many people ask me why I got into Data Science, to which I say; What better way to understand the patterns of the world. Data Science is so important in the knowings of how the world recieves information. From the "You may also like:..." list on Netflix, to translating other languages to english or another language, all the way to statistics for sports. Data Science is used for it all.</p>
				<p><i>I am</i> a customer oriented analyst who views scripting languages(Python, SQL, Scala) as my bread and butter. The thing that excites me about what I do is the constant opportunity to learn new skills and tricks, whether that's reading articles about new tech or finding better solutions to the "problems" I'm working on.</p>
				<p><i>I am</i> experienced leading small teams and training new hires; when a deadline needs to be met, I am frequently the one management entrusts to lead the charge. Communication is one of my most valuable assets; a skill that I have refined on the job, working with clients and colleagues alike.</p>
				<p><i>I am</i> a Data Specialist who's excited to build on existing skill sets and bring value to the team and company. I thrive when researching problems to find solutions, never giving up until the job is done. </p>
